# backpy
backpy is a simple python tool to create backups

Incremental backups are created by using hardlinks onto older backups if files are not changed.

This tool is designed to be simple and fast. It will not perform any encryption on backups. Use an encrypted volume like Bitlocker to encrypt your backups if needed.
